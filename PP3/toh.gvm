# Calculates the minimum number of moves for a Towers of Hanoi (TOH) solution. 
# The memory layout of the program after halting should be [N, Result] 
# where N was the number of disks passed into the program and Result is the minimum number of steps. 
# Try to reverse engineering other GVM programs to get your TOH program working. 
# A working program is worth 10 extra points and is defined in the second test case.
